## Bayesian Classification Models

This project implements **Univariate** and **Multivariate** Bayesian Classification models using Python.  
- **Univariate Model**: Classifies based on a single feature.  
- **Multivariate Model**: Uses the **Diabetes dataset** from an Excel file to classify based on multiple health features.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using Python.  
- **Task 1**: Predicts class of the first row using a sample dataset with `k = 3`.  
- **Task 2**: Calculates accuracy by predicting each row using the rest as training data.  
- **Task 3**: Loads an Excel dataset (fruit data) and predicts the class for the first row using `k = 5`.
